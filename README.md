# Senior-Capstone
Vision Statement:


By the end of the first semester, our group plans to complete the display of an aeronautical map in addition to a Google map and support various scales for the chart. We 
also plan on being able to transcribe the live speeches from LiveATC by building a special speech recognizer to transcribe these communications.
