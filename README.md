Vision Statement:

By the end of the project, our group plans to complete the display of an aeronautical and Google map with supported scalability and zoom functions.  We plan on displaying aircraft tracking information on the website in the form of planes with the ability to see the information of a selected aircraft in a text box. We also plan on being able to transcribe live speeches with an error rate of 20 percent from LiveATC through a speech recognizer and transcribing these communications onto the website in a draggable text box.
