From Electronic Communications: A System Approach by Jeffery S. Beasley, Jonathan D. Hymer, and Gary M. Miller:
#1-4 Noise
* Noise: undesired voltages or currents that come from the output of a receiver
* Noise is broadband and is a mixture of all frequencies with random occuring amplitudes.
* Two types of noise: Internal and External
% External Noise
* Human-made noise it the most troublesome.
* Atmospheric noise comes from natural disturbances in Earth's atmosphere.
	*Most troublesome at low frequencies; heard as static to AM recievers
* Space noise occurs around 8MHz up to 1.5GHz
% Internal Noise
* Electrical circuits produce noise from thermal interactions between electrons and the ions in the conductor.
* The bandwidth of the system as well as temperature play a part in the creation of white noise.
* Shot noise comes from transistor noise which often sounds similar to a group of lead shots falling on a metallic surface.
* Shot noise generally increases proportionally based on dc bias currents except when in metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors
where the shot noise seems to be independent of dc current levels.
* Around 1 kHz, low-frequency effect is called excess noise which is most likely due to crystal surface defects in semiconductors.
* Excesss noise is also referred to as pink noise.
* Transit-time noise is generated at high-frequencies.
* At a device's high-frequency cutoff, the high-frequency effect takes over and the noise increases rapidly.

#1-5 Noise Designation and Calculation
* Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is the relatice measure of the desired signal power to the noise power.
* In decibel form, SNR = 10log Ps/Pn
* The noise figure (NF) can be used to specify how noisy a device is, NF = 10logNR, where NR is the noise ratio.
* An octave is when the upper frequency is double that of the lower frequency. 

# 3-5 Noise Suppresssion
* Using FM over AM, there is less static noise heard in FM than in AM.
* In FM intelligence is not carried by amplitude changes but instead by frequency changes.
* A limiter is used to picked up and clip off an spikes in external noise.
* The result of clipping is what causes phase modulation which results in undesired FM.
* FM has the ability to minimize the effect of undesired signals that also applies to the reception of a station, that is undesired,
operating around the same frequency as the desired station.
* The ability of FM to suppress noise decreases with higher intelligence frequencies.
* The process known as preemphasis almost all FM transmissions are given an artifical boost to the electrical amplitude of the higher frequencies.
* Before the audio signal is fed into a modulator, the process of preemphasis increases the relative strength of the high-frequency components of 
the audio signal.
* The amount of noise for the preemphasis process does not change only the desired signal strength is increased.

# 6-5 Demodulation and Detectors
* A synchronous dectector regenerates the carrier from the recieved signal.
* The synchronous dector uses both a phase detector and a voltage-controlled oscillator.
