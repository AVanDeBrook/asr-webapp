Read through Jasper and Deep speech ATC papers provided Aaron and followed a few of the examples on the Nvidia Nemo website 

09/26/2022
Read and took notes on the jasper and squeeze papers provided by 
Aaron. 

10/05/2022 
Aaron pushed some example code to the github and linked us the

Created Sprint 1 presentaion

10/08/2022
Installed ubuntu and downloaded data from onedrive then transformed it using atcc.py

10/12/2022
created splitjson.py 
this file splits the json file created by 
atcc.py into too a train and test file 

10/20/2022 
Fixed packakges on home machine
created process to install required stuff on school machines

10/31/2022
updated splitjson.py to also pull datafrom hiwire dataset and to allow us to more easly change the ratio of training data to validation data

11/1/2022 
Created model_names.txt to hold the information about the names of the models in nemo that we will be using to train

11/07/2022 
Pytorch works but is unable to use gpu acceleration. Tested word error rate scripts found and ran example models

11/15/2022 
Created train_score.py that trains and then immediately scores the models. Also updated splitjson.py to remove any 
audio clip that has a duration < 1

11/30/2022
Submitted a discussion post on the Nvidia nemo github to try and get an answer to the error we have gotten.

12/05/2022
Trained using just the Hiwire dataset and it trained successfully. Something about how atcc.py is saving the .wav is screwing with nemos ability to open and see the files.  

01/26/2023
Downloaded and modified config files for the models we wish to use for our project. Modified our current training scrpits to use these new config files.
Begain training on these new models.

02/09/2023
Created script to train tokenizer and was successful implemented data fix found by braden and Aaron

02/14/2023
Created a script to train a citrinet model with tokenizer having issues with config files

02/16/2023
used the nemo provided script to train a tokenizer then updated train_citrinet_with_tokenizer to work properly and started training.
Created a python class for tyler to use on the website and helped braden create a blank quartznet model to train
