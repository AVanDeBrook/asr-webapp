1/19/23
- Use pattern matching for click callbacks for plane icons
- Write plane-specific info in popup div on plane icon click
- Ran into limitation for OpenSky API: In development, plotly dash restarts very regularly, causing lots of calls to the API. Limitation is 2k requests per day, and I think I hit it. Maybe store test data locally from now on...
- Add units to popup box

- Add error handling for opensky api so website doesn't crash
- Remove old openseadragon map code

1/21/23:
- If plane already selected and plane refresh happens, fetch new data for the currently selected plane to put in the popup
- If plane already selected and plane refresh happens, fetch new data for the currently selected plane to put in the popup
- Change lookup for popup box plane info to dict
- Change the indexing of plane icon info to use kvp lookup instead of index. Fixed issues with planes having mismatched coords and details.
